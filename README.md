# 100 Days Of RTL
This project was created by Rahul Behl, who for 100 days documented his work, what he learned and has an organized repository on GitHub.

Each day has a task, an orderly specification, including script tests, UVM simulations and even some formal assertions. 

The final product is amazing - a small and simple RISC-V processor that I implemented myself.

The assignments are gradual and each stage makes use of the tools I have acquired so far.

In this project I slightly upgraded the tb files, instead of generating Regular tests, I performed automatic tests that give an indication if the component works or not without looking at the waveform.

The tests also give an indication of where the run failed and what we expected to receive compared to what we actually received.
