# 100 Days Of RTL
This project was created by Rahul Behl, who for a 100 days documented his work, what he learned and has an organized repository on GitHub.

Each day has a task, an orderly specification, including script tests, UVM simulations and even some formal assertions. 

The final product is amazing - a small and simple RISC-V processor that I implemented myself.

The assignments are gradual and each stage makes use of the tools I have acquired so far.
